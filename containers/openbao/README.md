# Openbao
Couldn't find a decent container for a simple single host with the ui build in.

This image requires a hand built openbao image from the repo to be placed in downloads/

Making a self signed cert can be done according to chatgpt.md

downloads/release.docker/docker-entrypoint.sh is copied from the openbao repo
Dockerfile.openbao is also largely adapted from the openbao repo
